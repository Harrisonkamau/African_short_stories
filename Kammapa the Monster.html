  <h1>Kammapa the Monster!</h1>
  <p>
    Once there was a terrible monster, named Kammapa, that devoured all humans in Africa.
  </p>
  <p>
    Eventually the only person left in the world was an old woman who had fearfully gone into hiding, when she saw what was happening.
  </p>
  <p>
    One day, without the aid of a man, she gave birth to a boy-child who was adorned with magical amulets.She named her son Lituolone, in honour of her god.
  </p>
  <p>
    By nightfall, the boy was a full-grown strong young man.
  </p>
  <p>
    He asked his mother where the other people were, and being told of Kammapa, grabbed a knife and went to fight Kammapa the monster.
  </p>
  <p>
    But before he could do any-thing, the huge monster swallowed him in one gulp.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finding himself unharmed in the beast's stomach, Lituolone used his knife to cut his way out.
  </p>
  <p>
    In tearing apart the beast's stomach, he allowed thousands of human beings to escape with him.
  </p>
  <p>
    And that's how Africa was re-populated again, and Lituolone become the founder of the Sesuto tribe.
